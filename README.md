## Info
I've been researching DID(Decentralized Identifiers) and VC(Verifiable Credentials) as a graduation thesis in high school. I've just started reading specifications of DID/VC, and I will keep it throughout 2021.
Since I also have interest in Network Architecture and Security, I've been studying fundamental cryptographic and web security.
Furthermore, I'm going to study more basic knowledges a web developer has to have (Docker,AWS,GCP etc..).
